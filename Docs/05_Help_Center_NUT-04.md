## 2. Getting Started — Onboarding Guide

### 2.1 What is NUT-04?
NutriScore is a free browser extension that shows you an at-a-glance A–E nutrition grade — and personal dietary warnings if you want them — right on Naivas and Carrefour Kenya product listings, without slowing down your shopping.

*This works whether or not you have a diagnosed condition: the A–E grade is scientifically validated on its own, and the optional warning modules add a second layer for anyone managing diabetes, high blood pressure, heart health, or kidney health.*

### 2.2 Onboarding Flow

| Step | Title | Content |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | See your score at checkout | Install the extension, then browse any product listing on naivas.online, naivas.co.ke, carrefour.ke, or carrefourkenya.com. A colored badge appears on each recognized product card within about a second — no click required to see the grade itself. |
| 2 | Understand what the grade means | Tap the badge if you want the full nutrient breakdown per 100g or 100ml, plus a data-confidence label. Most shoppers can stop at step 1 — the letter is designed to be the whole answer for a quick decision. |
| 3 | Set up your dietary flags (optional) | If a condition applies to you, open Settings and turn on diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular, and/or kidney warnings. If none apply, leave them off — the grade badge works fine on its own and nothing about the extension changes if you skip this step. |

### 2.3 Quick-Start Checklist for New Shoppers
- [ ] Install NUT-04 from the Chrome Web Store (or load the beta build if you're a pilot tester)
- [ ] Visit a Naivas or Carrefour Kenya product listing and confirm a badge appears
- [ ] If a health condition applies to you, open Settings and turn on the relevant flag(s) — otherwise, skip this
- [ ] Add an item to your cart and confirm it appears on your Dashboard afterward

## 3. Core Feature Guides

### 3.1 Understanding Your Checkout Score

**Overview:** Your NutriScore grade (A through E) is based on the UK Food Standards Agency's Nutrient Profiling Model, updated for 2023, adapted to Kenyan grocery products using local nutrition data. It's valid whether or not you have a diagnosed condition — it's a general nutritional-quality signal, not a diagnostic tool.

**How it's calculated:** We look at the "negatives" in a product — calories, sugar, saturated fat, and salt — and subtract points for the "positives" — fibre, protein, and (for some foods) fruit/vegetable content. A few special food types — drinks, cheeses, fats & oils, and red or processed meats — use slightly adjusted rules.

**Grade Scale Reference**

| Grade | Meaning | Visual Indicator |
|---|---|---|
| A | Best nutritional choice in its category — Excellent | Dark green badge |
| B | Good nutritional choice | Light green badge |
| C | Moderate — fine in moderation | Yellow badge |
| D | Less healthy — a better alternative likely exists | Orange badge |
| E | Least healthy in its category | Red badge |

**Important note shown on every warning panel:** *"This information is based on standard thresholds and is not medical advice. Consult a healthcare provider."* This applies to the grade badge and every disease-specific warning — NUT-04 is a shopping aid, not a substitute for advice from a doctor, nutritionist, or dietician.

### 3.2 Disease-Specific Warnings (Optional)

**Overview:** If you turn on a health condition in Settings, NUT-04 checks each product against a threshold specific to that condition and shows a plain-language warning when it's exceeded — in addition to, not instead of, the general grade.

**Available modules:**
- **Diabetes** — flags products with more than 22.5g of sugar per 100g
- **Hypertension** — flags products with more than 600mg of sodium per 100g, and shows the exact value
- **Heart health (cardiovascular)** — flags products high in saturated fat or moderately-to-highly elevated in sodium
- **Kidney health** — flags products high in sodium (potassium-based flagging is planned but not yet reliably available, since most product listings don't include potassium data yet)

**Tips:**
- These modules are independent — turning one on doesn't affect the others, and none of them change the general A–E grade shown to everyone.
- If a warning shows up, it's describing one nutrient crossing one threshold — not a verdict on the whole product. A product can still be graded B or C overall while triggering a specific warning relevant to your condition.

### 3.3 Making Healthy Substitutions

**Overview:** When you view a lower-graded product, NUT-04 is designed to look for a similar product in the same food category that's graded higher and priced the same or less, and suggest it as a swap — particularly useful if you're buying in bulk on a time budget and want a fast, confident substitution rather than a research project.

**Current status:** This feature is still being finished on our end. If you don't see suggestions yet on a product that seems like it should have them, that's expected for now, not a bug on your device — see our roadmap for progress.

**Tips for when it's live:**
- Alternatives will always be drawn from the same food category and the same retailer as the product you're viewing, and never priced higher.
- Each suggestion will explain *why* — the grade comparison and which specific nutrients improved — not just a bare "try this instead."

### 3.4 Tracking Your Shopping Health Over Time

**Overview:** Every item you add to your Naivas or Carrefour Kenya cart is automatically logged — no manual entry needed — to a private, on-device shopping ledger. Nothing leaves your browser unless you explicitly sign in to sync.

**Step-by-step Guide**
1. Shop normally — add and remove items as usual.
2. Open the Dashboard (right-click the toolbar icon → Options, or the popup's "Dashboard" link).
3. Choose a timeframe — Today, Week, Month, Year, or All time — to see your grade distribution, top categories, and sodium/sugar/saturated-fat trends.

**A note on tone:** this dashboard is meant to help you notice patterns over time, not to grade you personally or make you feel judged about any one purchase. If it ever feels more like a scorecard than a helpful summary, that's feedback worth sending us.

## 4. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 4.1 General

<details>
<summary>Which stores does NutriScore work on?</summary>

Naivas Online (naivas.online / naivas.co.ke) and Carrefour Kenya (carrefour.ke / carrefourkenya.com). Support for more Kenyan retailers may be added later.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Is NutriScore free?</summary>

Yes — NutriScore is a free browser extension, built as part of a JHUB Africa / AfyaVentures innovation project.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do I need a diagnosed health condition to get value from this?</summary>

No. The A–E grade is designed to be useful to everyone, whether or not you have a diagnosed condition — most Kenyan adults with a diet-related risk factor don't yet have a diagnosis, and the general grade is validated independently of one. The condition-specific warnings are an additional, optional layer for anyone managing diabetes, high blood pressure, heart health, or kidney health.
</details>

### 4.2 Scoring & Accuracy

<details>
<summary>Why does a product's score seem incorrect?</summary>

Grades are only as good as the nutrition data behind them. We label each product's data-confidence level so you know how much to trust a given grade — a grade based on that exact product's own verified nutrition panel is more reliable than one estimated from a similar product's category average. We're actively working on making that confidence labelling more consistent across both supported retailers.
</details>

### 4.3 Privacy & Data

<details>
<summary>What shopping data does NUT-04 use?</summary>

By default, everything — your cart contents, the grades you've viewed, and your shopping trends — stays stored locally in your browser's own on-device database. Nothing is sent to any server unless you choose to sign in for cross-device sync (currently in development). Only the product names on the page you're viewing are ever used to look up a grade, and that lookup happens entirely against data already bundled with the extension — not sent to any outside nutrition database.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I delete my data?</summary>

Yes — a "delete all my data" option is intended to be available in Settings, clearing your shopping ledger from your device immediately. If you can't find it in your current version, please let us know via GitHub Issues so we can confirm it's exposed correctly in your build.
</details>

### 4.4 Account & Settings

<details>
<summary>How do I turn dietary warnings on or off?</summary>

Open Settings from the popup or the Dashboard's options page and toggle diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular, and/or kidney warnings independently. All are off by default until you choose to enable the ones relevant to you — turning one on never enables the others.
</details>

## 5. Troubleshooting & Contact Support Escalation Path

### 5.1 Self-Service Troubleshooting

| Issue | Suggested Fix |
|---|---|
| Score not showing at checkout | Make sure you're on a product *listing* page — badges appear on product cards, not every page type. Try refreshing; if the page uses infinite scroll, scroll down slightly to trigger a re-scan. If it still doesn't appear after a few seconds, the product may not yet be in our database. |
| Substitution suggestions not appearing | This feature is still being finished — see our roadmap for current status. |
| A warning seems to conflict with the general grade | This is expected — a warning flags one specific nutrient crossing one specific threshold for a condition you've turned on; it isn't meant to override the overall A–E grade, which weighs several nutrients together. |
| Widget appears broken/misaligned | This can happen if the retailer recently redesigned part of their site. Please report it via the feedback link so we can update our detection. |

### 5.2 Contact Support Escalation Path
