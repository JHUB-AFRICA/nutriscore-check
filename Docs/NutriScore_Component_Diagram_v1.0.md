# **1. Purpose and Scope**

This document presents the complete UML 2.5.1 Component Diagram for the NutriScore Checkout Tool (NUT-04). It defines every architectural component, the interfaces each component provides and requires, and the operational connections that implement the nutritional scoring workflow for Kenyan online grocery shoppers.

The diagram covers three architectural layers -- Client/Frontend Extension, Core Logic Engines, and Data & Integration -- plus the eight canonical data model entities that flow between them. All component names, interface names, and data entity names are canonical per the Terminology Reconciliation Log and Project Domain Model v2.0.

|  |
| --- |
| **\* Requirements traceability:** Every component in this diagram traces to at least one functional requirement in NutriScore\_Requirements\_v2\_Evidence\_Linked. Interface boundaries enforce the data minimisation rule (DATA-001), the 2023 FSA-NPS category-first architecture (FR-006), and the adapter pattern for retailer extensibility (NFR-005). The component boundary between BackgroundServiceWorker and the engine layer enforces the principle that ContentScript contains zero business logic. |

# **2. UML Notation Guide**

This document uses UML 2.5.1 Component Diagram notation. The following conventions apply throughout.

| **Symbol** | **UML Name** | **Rendered As (text notation)** | **Meaning in NUT-04** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Component] | Component | Rectangle with <<component>> stereotype | An autonomous architectural unit with defined interfaces. Examples: ScoreEngine, ContentScript. |
| O--- | Provided Interface (lollipop) | Circle on a stem extending from the component boundary | The component implements and exposes this interface for others to call. Example: ScoreEngine provides ScoringPort. |
| ---[ | Required Interface (socket) | Half-circle (socket) on the component boundary | The component depends on this interface being provided by another component. Example: BackgroundServiceWorker requires ScoringPort from ScoreEngine. |
| ---> | Assembly Connector | Lollipop mated with socket (lollipop fits inside socket) | Two components are connected via a matched provided/required interface pair. |
| - - -> | Usage Dependency | Dashed arrow with open head | One component uses another but not via a formal interface; typically async or conditional. |
| {package} | Package / Layer | Dashed rectangle containing components | Groups components into an architectural layer (Frontend Extension, Core Logic, Data & Integration). |
| <<data entity>> | Data type annotation | Italicised label near arrow | Names the data structure flowing across a connection (e.g., NutritionalProfile, HealthWarning). |

|  |
| --- |
| **i Reading convention:** Throughout this document, interface names follow the pattern ComponentNamePort. A provided interface is written as O--[InterfaceName]. A required interface is written as [InterfaceName]--[. Assembly connectors are written as O--[InterfaceName]--[ showing the lollipop-to-socket pairing. |

# **3. Component Overview**

The NutriScore Checkout Tool comprises eleven architectural components organised into three layers. The following table provides a one-line functional summary of each component before the detailed interface specification in Section 4.

| **Component** | **Layer** | **Module / File** | **Functional Summary** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UIWidget | Client / Frontend | widget.tsx (Preact) | Renders the NutritionalScore badge (LetterGrade A-E), NOVAProcessingLevel tag, HealthWarning panels, and AlternativeRecommendation drawer in the browser via Shadow DOM. The only component visible to the Consumer. |
| ContentScript | Client / Frontend | content-script.ts | Injected into supported retailer pages (Naivas, Carrefour Kenya). Uses a MutationObserver (300ms debounce) to detect GroceryProduct DOM elements asynchronously. Bridges UIWidget and BackgroundServiceWorker via chrome.runtime messaging. |
| BackgroundServiceWorker | Client / Frontend | background.ts | Extension lifecycle manager and central router. Implements cache-first strategy (IndexedDBCache lookup before API call), request deduplication (GroceryProductID hash), and dispatches NutritionalProfile to all four engines. |
| ScoreEngine | Core Logic | score-engine.ts | Implements the 2023 FSA-NPS algorithm across all five FSAProductCategories. Receives NutritionalProfile + FSAProductCategoryCode from FoodClassifier. Outputs NutritionalScore (LetterGrade, NumericScore, AlgorithmVersion="FSA-NPS-2023"). |
| FoodClassifier | Core Logic | food-classifier.ts | Assigns FSAProductCategoryCode (GENERAL\_FOOD, RED\_MEAT, CHEESE, ADDED\_FAT, BEVERAGE) to each GroceryProduct. Applies the SPF exclusion gate (baby food, sports nutrition, supplements). Outputs FSAProductCategory and NOVAProcessingLevel. |
| DiseaseEngine | Core Logic | disease-engine.ts | Evaluates NutritionalProfile against active DiseaseRules (DR-001 to DR-006). Generates HealthWarning objects when thresholds are exceeded. Injects AI-003 disclaimer into every HealthWarning. |
| AlternativesEngine | Core Logic | alternatives-engine.ts | Produces ranked AlternativeRecommendation objects for D/E-scored GroceryProducts. Applies three-factor ranking: LetterGrade rank, FSAProductCategory match (mandatory), price proximity +/-30%. |
| IndexedDBCache | Data & Integration | idb wrapper | Local browser key-value store. Caches NutritionalProfile (7 fields; 7-day TTL), NutritionalScore, and ShoppingHistory. Stores UserProfile.HealthConditionToggles. Never transmits data externally (DATA-004). |
| KenyanFallbackDatabase | Data & Integration | fallback-db.json (bundled) | Bundled JSON dataset of 200+ Kenyan-market GroceryProducts with NutritionalProfile. Queried when OpenFoodFactsAPI returns no match for a product name. All 7 required NutritionalProfile fields present; FibreG estimated where unavailable. |
| OpenFoodFactsAPI | Data & Integration | External HTTPS API | Open Food Facts REST API v2 (world.openfoodfacts.org). Queried by product name (HTTPS only; no user identifier in request). Primary nutrition data source for internationally recognised products. CC BY-SA 4.0 licence. |

# **4. Provided and Required Interface Specification**

This section documents every interface each component exposes (provided -- lollipop) and every interface each component depends on (required -- socket). Assembly connectors are identified in Section 5.

## **4.1 UIWidget**

|  |
| --- |
| **[Component] UIWidget**  *User-facing overlay: badge, warnings, alternatives drawer, settings panel* |

| **Direction** | **Interface Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| REQUIRED | RenderDataPort | socket [ | Receives SCORE\_RESPONSE from ContentScript containing NutritionalScore, NOVAProcessingLevel, and []HealthWarning. The primary data input for badge rendering. |
| REQUIRED | AlternativeDataPort | socket [ | Receives ALTERNATIVES\_RESPONSE from BackgroundServiceWorker containing ranked []AlternativeRecommendation objects. |
| PROVIDED | UserInteractionPort | lollipop O-- | Exposes user trigger events to ContentScript: badge click, "See alternatives" click, settings panel open, consent modal response, "Delete all my data" action. |
| PROVIDED | ConsentPort | lollipop O-- | Emits consumer consent decision (accept / decline) to BackgroundServiceWorker on first-run modal interaction. DATA-002 enforcement point. |

|  |
| --- |
| **i Design constraint:** UIWidget uses Shadow DOM CSS encapsulation to prevent its styles from affecting or being affected by retailer page CSS (NFR-002). All grade colours are applied via CSS custom properties, never inline style strings (NFR-006). Every visual element exposes an aria-label for screen reader compatibility (ACC-001, NFR-007). |

## **4.2 ContentScript**

|  |
| --- |
| **[Component] ContentScript**  *DOM observer and chrome.runtime messaging bridge* |

| **Direction** | **Interface Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PROVIDED | ProductDetectionPort | lollipop O-- | Exposes detected GroceryProduct metadata (ProductName, RetailerCode, GroceryProductID, PriceKES) to BackgroundServiceWorker via SCORE\_REQUEST chrome.runtime message. Fired by MutationObserver with 300ms debounce. |
| PROVIDED | WidgetRenderPort | lollipop O-- | Passes SCORE\_RESPONSE payload from BackgroundServiceWorker to UIWidget for badge and warning panel rendering. |
| REQUIRED | ScoreResponsePort | socket [ | Receives SCORE\_RESPONSE from BackgroundServiceWorker: NutritionalScore, NOVAProcessingLevel, []HealthWarning. |

|  |
| --- |
| **i Design constraint:** ContentScript contains zero business logic. It detects products and passes messages -- all computation happens in BackgroundServiceWorker and the engine layer. This boundary is enforced architecturally so that future retailer adapter changes never touch the scoring pipeline (NFR-005). |

## **4.3 BackgroundServiceWorker**

|  |
| --- |
| **[Component] BackgroundServiceWorker**  *Central hub: cache management, API dispatch, engine orchestration* |

| **Direction** | **Interface Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PROVIDED | RoutingPort | lollipop O-- | Accepts SCORE\_REQUEST from ContentScript; coordinates the full analysis pipeline; returns SCORE\_RESPONSE to ContentScript. |
| PROVIDED | CacheManagementPort | lollipop O-- | Manages IndexedDBCache reads and writes: cache-first NutritionalProfile lookup (7-day TTL), NutritionalScore storage, ShoppingHistory recording (only after consent via DATA-002), UserProfile.HealthConditionToggles persistence. |
| PROVIDED | AlternativesRoutingPort | lollipop O-- | Accepts ALTERNATIVES\_REQUEST from UIWidget via ContentScript; dispatches to AlternativesEngine; returns ALTERNATIVES\_RESPONSE. |
| REQUIRED | NutritionLookupPort | socket [ | Calls OpenFoodFactsAPI (HTTPS, no user identifier) on cache miss. Falls back to KenyanFallbackDatabase if OpenFoodFactsAPI returns no match or times out (>3s). |
| REQUIRED | ScoringPort | socket [ | Dispatches NutritionalProfile + FSAProductCategoryCode to ScoreEngine; receives NutritionalScore. |
| REQUIRED | ClassificationPort | socket [ | Dispatches NutritionalProfile + ProductName to FoodClassifier; receives FSAProductCategoryCode, NOVAProcessingLevel, IsExcluded flag. |
| REQUIRED | DiseaseEvaluationPort | socket [ | Dispatches NutritionalProfile + active UserProfile.HealthConditionToggles to DiseaseEngine; receives []HealthWarning. |
| REQUIRED | AlternativesPort | socket [ | Dispatches SourceGroceryProductID + FSAProductCategoryCode + PriceKES to AlternativesEngine; receives ranked []AlternativeRecommendation. |
| REQUIRED | CacheReadWritePort | socket [ | Reads and writes IndexedDBCache via the idb library wrapper. Cache key: GroceryProductID (deterministic hash of ProductName + RetailerURL). |

|  |
| --- |
| **! Security constraint:** BackgroundServiceWorker enforces DATA-004: only ProductName (as a plain string) is included in outbound requests to OpenFoodFactsAPI. No GroceryProductID, no UserID, no HealthConditionToggles, and no ShoppingHistory data is ever transmitted externally. CSP in manifest.json restricts connect-src to https://world.openfoodfacts.org only (SEC-001). |

## **4.4 ScoreEngine**

|  |
| --- |
| **[Component] ScoreEngine**  *2023 FSA-NPS algorithm: five-category scoring, letter grade output* |

| **Direction** | **Interface Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| REQUIRED | NutritionalProfileInputPort | socket [ | Receives NutritionalProfile (7 fields) + FSAProductCategoryCode from BackgroundServiceWorker. FSAProductCategoryCode MUST be present before scoring begins (BR-101: category-first architecture). |
| PROVIDED | ScoringPort | lollipop O-- | Returns NutritionalScore {LetterGrade: A|B|C|D|E|UNSCORED, NumericScore: Integer, FSACategoryUsed: Enum, AlgorithmVersion: "FSA-NPS-2023"} to BackgroundServiceWorker. |

|  |
| --- |
| **! Algorithm constraint (BR-102):** ScoreEngine MUST implement the 2023 FSA-NPS revision (SPF workbook, 4 April 2024). The 2017 algorithm is deprecated for products placed on market after January 2024. Five distinct formula paths are required: GENERAL\_FOOD (N<11 rule), RED\_MEAT (protein capped at 2 pts), CHEESE (always N-P), ADDED\_FAT (SFA-to-total-fat ratio; N<7 rule), BEVERAGE (sweetener +4 penalty; water flag). AlgorithmVersion="FSA-NPS-2023" is mandatory in every NutritionalScore output (BR-102). |

## **4.5 FoodClassifier**

|  |
| --- |
| **[Component] FoodClassifier**  *FSAProductCategory assignment and SPF exclusion gate* |

| **Direction** | **Interface Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| REQUIRED | ProductMetadataInputPort | socket [ | Receives NutritionalProfile + ProductName string from BackgroundServiceWorker for category classification. |
| PROVIDED | ClassificationPort | lollipop O-- | Returns {FSAProductCategoryCode: GENERAL\_FOOD|RED\_MEAT|CHEESE|ADDED\_FAT|BEVERAGE, NOVAProcessingLevel: 1|2|3|4|null, IsExcluded: boolean} to BackgroundServiceWorker. |

|  |
| --- |
| **i Exclusion gate (BR-104, FR-007):** If IsExcluded = true, BackgroundServiceWorker immediately sends SCORE\_RESPONSE(suppressed=true) to ContentScript and UIWidget renders no badge. No ScoreEngine, DiseaseEngine, or AlternativesEngine call is made. Excluded categories (permanent SPF exclusions per EV-SCI-007): baby food (0-3 years), sports nutrition products, food for special medical purposes, dietary supplements, meal replacement products. |

## **4.6 DiseaseEngine**

|  |
| --- |
| **[Component] DiseaseEngine**  *DiseaseRule evaluation, HealthWarning generation, AI-003 disclaimer injection* |

| **Direction** | **Interface Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| REQUIRED | NutritionalProfileEvalPort | socket [ | Receives NutritionalProfile + UserProfile.HealthConditionToggles from BackgroundServiceWorker. |
| REQUIRED | DiseaseRuleStorePort | socket [ | Reads active DiseaseRules (DR-001 to DR-006) from bundled constants in disease-engine.ts. Not a runtime interface -- the rule set is compiled in. |
| PROVIDED | DiseaseEvaluationPort | lollipop O-- | Returns []HealthWarning to BackgroundServiceWorker. Each HealthWarning contains: HealthConditionCode, NutrientField, ActualValue, ThresholdValue, AlertSeverityLevel, plain-language warning text (Flesch-Kincaid Grade <=8), and the AI-003 disclaimer string. |

Active DiseaseRule threshold values (seeded in disease-engine.ts; pending KNDI review in Phase 5):

| **Rule ID** | **HealthConditionCode** | **NutrientField** | **Threshold** | **Unit** | **Severity** | **Requirement** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DR-001 | DIABETES | SugarsG | >22.5 | g/100g | FLAG | FR-009, EV-SCI-001 |
| DR-002 | HYPERTENSION | SodiumMG | >600 | mg/100g | FLAG | FR-010, EV-SCI-002 |
| DR-003 | CVD | SaturatedFatG | >5 (conj.) | g/100g | CAUTION | FR-011 |
| DR-004 | CVD | SodiumMG | >400 (conj.) | mg/100g | CAUTION | FR-011 |
| DR-005 | KIDNEY | Potassium | >200 (conj.) | mg/100g | WARNING | FR-012 |
| DR-006 | KIDNEY | SodiumMG | >600 (conj.) | mg/100g | WARNING | FR-012 |

## **4.7 AlternativesEngine**

|  |
| --- |
| **[Component] AlternativesEngine**  *Multi-factor alternative ranking, ExplanationText generation* |

| **Direction** | **Interface Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| REQUIRED | SourceProductInputPort | socket [ | Receives SourceGroceryProductID, FSAProductCategoryCode, and PriceKES from BackgroundServiceWorker. Only invoked for GroceryProducts with LetterGrade D or E. |
| REQUIRED | CandidateLookupPort | socket [ | Queries IndexedDBCache for GroceryProducts matching: same FSAProductCategoryCode (MANDATORY per BR-109), LetterGrade in {A, B, C}, PriceKES within +/-30% of source (widened to +/-50% if fewer than 3 results found). |
| PROVIDED | AlternativesPort | lollipop O-- | Returns ranked []AlternativeRecommendation to BackgroundServiceWorker. Each recommendation contains: AlternativeGroceryProductID, LetterGrade, FSAProductCategoryMatch=true, RelevanceScore (0.60\*GradeRank + 0.30\*CategoryMatch + 0.10\*PriceProximity), ExplanationText (Flesch-Kincaid <=8), AI-003 disclaimer. |

|  |
| --- |
| **i Category match is mandatory, not optional (BR-109):** Cross-category comparisons are scientifically invalid Nutri-Score comparisons. The FSAProductCategoryCode filter is the first filter applied, before grade or price. AlternativesEngine will not return a result from a different FSAProductCategory regardless of price proximity or LetterGrade. |

## **4.8 IndexedDBCache**

|  |
| --- |
| **[Component] IndexedDBCache**  *Local browser storage: profiles, scores, history, user preferences* |

| **Direction** | **Interface Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PROVIDED | CacheReadWritePort | lollipop O-- | Exposes get(key), set(key, value, TTL), delete(key), clear(), and query(filter) operations to BackgroundServiceWorker. Key format: GroceryProductID (deterministic UUID hash). |
| PROVIDED | HistoryWritePort | lollipop O-- | Accepts ShoppingHistory records (GroceryProductID, NutritionalScoreLetterGrade, ScannedAt, UserID) after UserProfile.ConsentGrantedAt is confirmed set (DATA-002 enforcement). |
| PROVIDED | UserProfilePort | lollipop O-- | Accepts UserProfile writes (HealthConditionToggles, ConsentGrantedAt, ConsentVersion) from BackgroundServiceWorker. Never transmitted externally. |

IndexedDBCache store schema (DATA-001 data minimisation):

| **Store Name** | **Key** | **Value Schema** | **Data Minimisation Rule** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| products | GroceryProductID | GroceryProduct (ProductName, FSAProductCategoryCode, PriceKES, IsExcluded, RetailerCode, CachedAt) | No PII. ProductName is used only as an OFacts query string -- not linked to any user identity. |
| profiles | GroceryProductID | NutritionalProfile (exactly 7 fields: EnergyKJ, SugarsG, SaturatedFatG, SodiumMG, ProteinG, FibreG, FVLPercent + DataSourceCode + FibreGEstimated + LastUpdated) | Exactly 7 nutrient fields per DATA-001. API response parser strips all other OFacts fields before storage. |
| scores | GroceryProductID | NutritionalScore (LetterGrade, NumericScore, FSACategoryUsed, AlgorithmVersion, ScoredAt) | No PII. Score is a computed output -- not a user data item. |
| history | HistoryID | ShoppingHistory (UserID, GroceryProductID, NutritionalScoreLetterGrade, ScannedAt) | Only recorded after ConsentGrantedAt is set (DATA-002). Deleted on user request within 1 second (DATA-003, TC-DEL). |
| userProfile | UserID | UserProfile (HealthConditionToggles JSON, ConsentGrantedAt, ConsentVersion) | HealthConditionToggles are system classification codes -- not medical diagnoses. Never transmitted externally (DATA-004, SEC-003). |

## **4.9 KenyanFallbackDatabase**

|  |
| --- |
| **[Component] KenyanFallbackDatabase**  *Bundled JSON: 200+ Kenyan-market products with all 7 NutritionalProfile fields* |

| **Direction** | **Interface Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PROVIDED | FallbackLookupPort | lollipop O-- | Exposes get(ProductName) -> NutritionalProfile | null to BackgroundServiceWorker. Called only when OpenFoodFactsAPI returns no match or times out (>3s). Response time target: <100ms (bundled JSON, no network call). |

|  |
| --- |
| **! Critical path status (EV-SCI-012, EV-003):** KenyanFallbackDatabase is load-bearing, not supplementary. Open Food Facts has sparse coverage of Kenyan-market brands (Kabras, Kenchic, Kimbo, Unga) per Phase 1 API testing. Recommendation quality is bounded by database coverage -- a finding from peer-reviewed AINR research (Kalpakoglou et al. 2025). Minimum 200 entries required before Phase 7 development begins (Project Plan Gate G5). FibreG must be included for all entries, estimated from food composition tables where direct measurements are unavailable (BR-105, EV-SCI-008). |

## **4.10 OpenFoodFactsAPI**

|  |
| --- |
| **[Component] OpenFoodFactsAPI**  *External HTTPS API: global open nutrition database (CC BY-SA 4.0)* |

| **Direction** | **Interface Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PROVIDED | NutritionLookupPort | lollipop O-- | Accepts HTTPS GET /api/v2/search?query={ProductName}. Returns NutritionalProfile JSON (7 required fields + nova\_group) or empty result. Timeout: 3 seconds. Rate limit: 100 req/min (request deduplication in BackgroundServiceWorker prevents limit breaches). |

| **Integration Parameter** | **Value** |
| --- | --- |
| Base URL | https://world.openfoodfacts.org |
| Endpoint | /api/v2/search?query={ProductName}&fields=energy\_kj,sugars\_100g,saturated-fat\_100g,sodium\_100g,proteins\_100g,fiber\_100g,nova\_group |
| Protocol | HTTPS only (SEC-001). HTTP fallback disabled in CSP. |
| Authentication | None required for free tier. User-Agent header set to identify NUT-04 extension per Open Food Facts policy. |
| Timeout | 3 seconds. On timeout: KenyanFallbackDatabase queried. If fallback also misses: NFR-008 grey badge rendered. |
| Rate limit | 100 requests per minute. Mitigated by: (1) request deduplication via GroceryProductID hash in BackgroundServiceWorker; (2) 7-day IndexedDBCache TTL prevents repeat API calls for same product. |
| Licence | Open Food Facts data: CC BY-SA 4.0. Attribution required in extension credits and Privacy Policy (Phase 9 deliverable). |
| Data fields returned | energy\_kj, sugars\_100g, saturated-fat\_100g (SaturatedFatG), sodium\_100g (converted to mg), proteins\_100g, fiber\_100g, nova\_group. All other fields stripped by BackgroundServiceWorker response parser before IndexedDBCache write (DATA-001). |

# **5. Assembly Connectors and Operational Workflow**

This section documents all assembly connectors (provided interface mated with required interface) and the operational message flow that implements the NutriScore scoring workflow from GroceryProduct detection to UIWidget render.

## **5.1 Connector Register**

| **ID** | **Provider Component** | **Provided Interface** | **Consumer Component** | **Data Payload / Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AC-001 | ContentScript | ProductDetectionPort | BackgroundServiceWorker | SCORE\_REQUEST: {GroceryProductID, ProductName, RetailerCode, PriceKES}. Fired by MutationObserver (300ms debounce) on new GroceryProduct DOM element (FR-001). |
| AC-002 | BackgroundServiceWorker | RoutingPort | ContentScript | SCORE\_RESPONSE: {NutritionalScore, NOVAProcessingLevel, []HealthWarning}. Returned to ContentScript for relay to UIWidget. Total latency <= 2 seconds (NFR-001). |
| AC-003 | UIWidget | UserInteractionPort | ContentScript | User events: badge click, "See alternatives" trigger, settings open, consent decision. One-way flow from UIWidget to ContentScript to BackgroundServiceWorker. |
| AC-004 | IndexedDBCache | CacheReadWritePort | BackgroundServiceWorker | Cache check: get(GroceryProductID). Cache hit (age <7 days) -> skip to AC-002. Cache miss -> proceed to AC-005. |
| AC-005 | OpenFoodFactsAPI | NutritionLookupPort | BackgroundServiceWorker | GET /api/v2/search?query={ProductName}. Returns NutritionalProfile or empty result. HTTPS only. No user identifier in request (DATA-004). |
| AC-006 | KenyanFallbackDatabase | FallbackLookupPort | BackgroundServiceWorker | get(ProductName) -> NutritionalProfile | null. Only called when AC-005 returns no match or times out (>3s). |
| AC-007 | BackgroundServiceWorker | RoutingPort | FoodClassifier | Forwards NutritionalProfile + ProductName for FSAProductCategory assignment and SPF exclusion gate check. MUST be called before ScoreEngine (BR-101). |
| AC-008 | FoodClassifier | ClassificationPort | BackgroundServiceWorker | {FSAProductCategoryCode, NOVAProcessingLevel, IsExcluded}. If IsExcluded=true: AC-002 returns suppressed=true immediately; no AC-009 to AC-012 calls made. |
| AC-009 | BackgroundServiceWorker | RoutingPort | ScoreEngine | Forwards NutritionalProfile + FSAProductCategoryCode (from AC-008) to ScoreEngine. FSAProductCategoryCode required in payload (BR-101). |
| AC-010 | ScoreEngine | ScoringPort | BackgroundServiceWorker | NutritionalScore {LetterGrade, NumericScore, FSACategoryUsed, AlgorithmVersion="FSA-NPS-2023"}. AlgorithmVersion validated before caching. |
| AC-011 | BackgroundServiceWorker | RoutingPort | DiseaseEngine | Forwards NutritionalProfile + UserProfile.HealthConditionToggles. DiseaseEngine evaluates all active DiseaseRules in parallel with AC-009. |
| AC-012 | DiseaseEngine | DiseaseEvaluationPort | BackgroundServiceWorker | []HealthWarning. Zero items = no thresholds exceeded. Each item contains ActualValue, ThresholdValue, plain-language text, AI-003 disclaimer. |
| AC-013 | BackgroundServiceWorker | AlternativesRoutingPort | AlternativesEngine | ALTERNATIVES\_REQUEST: {SourceGroceryProductID, FSAProductCategoryCode, PriceKES}. Only dispatched when Consumer clicks "See alternatives" AND LetterGrade is D or E. |
| AC-014 | AlternativesEngine | AlternativesPort | BackgroundServiceWorker | []AlternativeRecommendation (top 3+). Each item: AlternativeGroceryProductID, LetterGrade, RelevanceScore, ExplanationText, AI-003 disclaimer. FSAProductCategoryMatch=true on every item (BR-109). |
| AC-015 | IndexedDBCache | CacheReadWritePort | BackgroundServiceWorker | Cache write after AC-010: set(GroceryProductID, {NutritionalProfile, NutritionalScore}, TTL=7days). Only 7 NutritionalProfile fields written (DATA-001). |
| AC-016 | IndexedDBCache | HistoryWritePort | BackgroundServiceWorker | ShoppingHistory record written after AC-015 only if UserProfile.ConsentGrantedAt is set (DATA-002 enforcement). |

## **5.2 Operational Message Flow (Happy Path)**

The following numbered sequence describes the complete operational workflow from GroceryProduct detection to UIWidget render. This corresponds to System Sequence Diagram SD-001 in the System Sequence Catalogue.

1. Consumer opens a Naivas.co.ke product listing page. ContentScript MutationObserver fires after 300ms debounce, detecting a GroceryProduct DOM element. [FR-001]
2. ContentScript sends SCORE\_REQUEST {GroceryProductID, ProductName, RetailerCode, PriceKES} to BackgroundServiceWorker via chrome.runtime.sendMessage. [AC-001]
3. BackgroundServiceWorker checks IndexedDBCache.get(GroceryProductID). If cache hit (age <7 days): skip to step 10. [AC-004]
4. On cache miss: BackgroundServiceWorker calls OpenFoodFactsAPI GET /api/v2/search?query={ProductName}. Request: HTTPS only; no user identifier. [AC-005, SEC-001, DATA-004]
5. If OpenFoodFactsAPI returns no result or times out (>3s): BackgroundServiceWorker calls KenyanFallbackDatabase.get(ProductName). [AC-006, FR-002]
6. If KenyanFallbackDatabase also returns null: BackgroundServiceWorker sends SCORE\_RESPONSE {LetterGrade=UNSCORED} to ContentScript. UIWidget renders grey "?" badge. [NFR-008] -- END of flow for this product.
7. NutritionalProfile (7 fields) received. BackgroundServiceWorker calls FoodClassifier.classify(NutritionalProfile, ProductName). [AC-007, FR-006]
8. FoodClassifier assigns FSAProductCategoryCode and NOVAProcessingLevel; checks SPF exclusion gate. If IsExcluded=true: SCORE\_RESPONSE {suppressed=true} sent; UIWidget renders no badge. [AC-008, FR-007, BR-104] -- END for excluded products.
9. BackgroundServiceWorker dispatches in parallel: (a) ScoreEngine.score(NutritionalProfile, FSAProductCategoryCode) [AC-009, FR-003] and (b) DiseaseEngine.evaluate(NutritionalProfile, HealthConditionToggles) [AC-011, FR-005].
10. ScoreEngine computes NutritionalScore using 2023 FSA-NPS formula for FSAProductCategoryCode. Returns NutritionalScore {LetterGrade, NumericScore, AlgorithmVersion="FSA-NPS-2023"}. [AC-010]
11. DiseaseEngine evaluates all active DiseaseRules. Returns []HealthWarning (may be empty). Each HealthWarning includes AI-003 disclaimer text. [AC-012, AI-003]
12. BackgroundServiceWorker writes NutritionalProfile + NutritionalScore to IndexedDBCache (7-day TTL). If ConsentGrantedAt is set, ShoppingHistory record also written. [AC-015, AC-016, DATA-001, DATA-002]
13. BackgroundServiceWorker sends SCORE\_RESPONSE {NutritionalScore, NOVAProcessingLevel, []HealthWarning} to ContentScript via chrome.runtime.sendMessage. [AC-002]
14. ContentScript passes SCORE\_RESPONSE to UIWidget. UIWidget renders: (a) NutritionalScore badge (colour + letter via CSS custom properties), (b) NOVAProcessingLevel tag, (c) HealthWarning panels if []HealthWarning is non-empty. [FR-004, FR-008, FR-005, NFR-002, NFR-006, ACC-001]
15. Total elapsed time steps 1-14: <= 2 seconds on 25 Mbps 4G connection. CLS = 0.00 (Shadow DOM encapsulation). [NFR-001, NFR-002]

## **5.3 Alternative Flow: Consumer Requests Alternatives (SD-002)**

1. Consumer clicks "See healthier alternatives" in UIWidget for a GroceryProduct with LetterGrade D or E.
2. UIWidget sends ALTERNATIVES\_REQUEST via ContentScript to BackgroundServiceWorker: {SourceGroceryProductID, FSAProductCategoryCode, PriceKES}. [AC-013, FR-013]
3. BackgroundServiceWorker dispatches to AlternativesEngine. AlternativesEngine queries IndexedDBCache for candidates with: same FSAProductCategoryCode (MANDATORY, BR-109), LetterGrade in {A,B,C}, PriceKES within +/-30%.
4. If fewer than 3 candidates within 30%: widen price filter to +/-50%.
5. AlternativesEngine ranks candidates by RelevanceScore = 0.60\*(LetterGradeRank) + 0.30\*(CategoryMatch) + 0.10\*(PriceProximity). Generates ExplanationText per AI-002 for each.
6. BackgroundServiceWorker sends ALTERNATIVES\_RESPONSE {[]AlternativeRecommendation} to ContentScript to UIWidget. [AC-014]
7. UIWidget renders alternatives drawer: >=3 AlternativeRecommendation cards, each with NutritionalScore badge, ExplanationText, and AI-003 disclaimer.

# **6. Architectural Layer Summary**

## **6.1 Client / Frontend Extension Layer**

This layer runs entirely inside the Chrome browser extension sandbox. It has no server-side components. Communication between ContentScript and BackgroundServiceWorker uses the Chrome Extension Runtime Messaging API (chrome.runtime.sendMessage / chrome.runtime.onMessage). Communication between UIWidget and ContentScript is mediated by ContentScript -- UIWidget never communicates directly with BackgroundServiceWorker.

| **Component** | **Provided Interfaces** | **Required Interfaces** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UIWidget | UserInteractionPort, ConsentPort | RenderDataPort, AlternativeDataPort |

## **6.2 Core Logic Layer**

The four engine components are stateless and pure-function in nature: given the same inputs, they always produce the same outputs. This makes them independently unit-testable and replaceable without affecting other layers. None of the engines read from or write to IndexedDBCache directly -- all cache operations are handled by BackgroundServiceWorker (separation of concerns).

| **Component** | **Provided Interfaces** | **Required Interfaces** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ScoreEngine | ScoringPort | NutritionalProfileInputPort |
| FoodClassifier | ClassificationPort | ProductMetadataInputPort |
| DiseaseEngine | DiseaseEvaluationPort | NutritionalProfileEvalPort, DiseaseRuleStorePort (bundled constants) |
| AlternativesEngine | AlternativesPort | SourceProductInputPort, CandidateLookupPort |

## **6.3 Data & Integration Layer**

This layer manages all data persistence and external data access. IndexedDBCache is the only persistent store and it is strictly local to the Consumer device. OpenFoodFactsAPI is the only external network dependency; all other data access is either local cache or bundled JSON.

| **Component** | **Provided Interfaces** | **Required Interfaces** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IndexedDBCache | CacheReadWritePort, HistoryWritePort, UserProfilePort | None (data originates from BackgroundServiceWorker) |
| KenyanFallbackDatabase | FallbackLookupPort | None (bundled JSON, no external dependency) |
| OpenFoodFactsAPI | NutritionLookupPort | None (external service; HTTPS only) |

# **10. Architecture-to-Requirements Traceability**

Every component and every assembly connector in this diagram traces to at least one requirement in NutriScore\_Requirements\_v2\_Evidence\_Linked (NUT-04, June 2026).

| **Component / Connector** | **Requirement ID(s)** | **Design Decision** | **Evidence Chain** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ContentScript MutationObserver | FR-001 | 300ms debounce; no business logic in ContentScript | EV-002: Carrefour/Naivas use React/Vue lazy loading -- synchronous DOMContentLoaded misses products |
| BackgroundServiceWorker cache-first strategy | FR-002, NFR-001 | IndexedDBCache checked before OpenFoodFactsAPI; 7-day TTL | EV-003: OFacts coverage sparse; cache prevents repeated API calls and reduces latency to meet 2s budget |
| ScoreEngine 2023 FSA-NPS, 5-category paths | FR-003, FR-006 | Category-first architecture; AlgorithmVersion="FSA-NPS-2023" mandatory | EV-SCI-005/006: 5 distinct scoring formulas; 2023 revision corrects 7 scientific deficiencies from 2017 baseline |
| FoodClassifier SPF exclusion gate | FR-007 | Exclusion gate fires before ScoreEngine -- no API call wasted on excluded products | EV-SCI-007: permanent SPF exclusions (baby food, sports nutrition, supplements, meal replacements) |
| DiseaseEngine DR-001 to DR-006 | FR-009, FR-010, FR-011, FR-012 | DiseaseRules are bundled constants (not user-editable); thresholds KNDI-reviewed in Phase 5 | EV-SCI-001 (sugar -> cancer risk); EV-SCI-002 (sodium -> CVD mortality) |
| AlternativesEngine FSAProductCategory mandatory filter | FR-013, AI-001 | Cross-category comparisons blocked at engine level (not UI level) | Nutri-Score design intent: comparisons only valid within same food category |
| AI-003 disclaimer in DiseaseEngine and AlternativesEngine outputs | AI-003 | Disclaimer injected by engine, not by UIWidget -- cannot be accidentally omitted in display | EV-SCI-013: IARC and Kalpakoglou et al. 2025 both mandate human oversight and prohibition on medical advice framing |
| IndexedDBCache only 7 NutritionalProfile fields | DATA-001 | BackgroundServiceWorker response parser strips all OFacts fields not in the 7-field schema before IndexedDBCache write | Kenya DPA 2019 data minimisation; only fields required by FSA-NPS 2023 algorithm are stored |
| OpenFoodFactsAPI: HTTPS only; no user identifier | DATA-004, SEC-001 | CSP connect-src restricts to https://world.openfoodfacts.org; no GroceryProductID or UserID in query string | Kenya DPA 2019; Chrome Web Store privacy disclosure requirements; OWASP ASVS 9.2 |
| Shadow DOM CSS encapsulation in UIWidget | NFR-002 | Prevents CLS > 0 on retailer pages; prevents CSS conflicts with retailer page styles | SN-007: retail partners require zero page disruption as condition of adoption |
| Adapter pattern (IRetailerAdapter) | NFR-005 | Each retailer has its own adapter file; ScoreEngine, DiseaseEngine, and UIWidget are never modified for new retailers | Phase 5 multi-retailer expansion; maintainability requirement |
| CSS custom properties for grade colours (no inline style strings) | NFR-006, SEC-002 | Prevents XSS via CSS injection; grade colours are design-system tokens not runtime strings | OWASP ASVS 1.14.6; Chrome Web Store security review |
| KenyanFallbackDatabase bundled JSON | FR-002, DATA-001 | No network call required for fallback lookup (<100ms response); all 7 fields present including estimated FibreG | EV-003: OFacts sparse for Kenyan brands; EV-SCI-008: FibreG required by FSA-NPS but not on Kenyan labels; EV-SCI-012: DB coverage is primary quality bottleneck |

# **11. Key Design Constraints and Rationale**

## **11.1 Category-First Architecture (BR-101)**

FoodClassifier MUST run and return FSAProductCategoryCode before ScoreEngine is called. This is not an optimisation preference -- it is a scientific correctness requirement. The 2023 FSA-NPS algorithm has five distinct formula paths (GENERAL\_FOOD, RED\_MEAT, CHEESE, ADDED\_FAT, BEVERAGE) with different N-points tables, P-points constraints, score-combining rules, and letter grade cut-offs (EV-SCI-006). Calling ScoreEngine without a category code, or defaulting all products to GENERAL\_FOOD, produces wrong grades for red meat (protein overcounted), cheese (wrong combining rule), added fats (wrong energy and SFA calculation), and beverages (wrong thresholds; sweetener penalty missed).

## **11.2 No Business Logic in ContentScript**

ContentScript contains only MutationObserver event handling, DOM scraping (ProductName, PriceKES, RetailerCode), message forwarding (SCORE\_REQUEST, SCORE\_RESPONSE relay), and UIWidget injection via chrome.tabs.executeScript. Zero nutritional calculation, classification, or disease evaluation logic lives here. This constraint ensures that adding a new retailer (Phase 5) requires only a new IRetailerAdapter file -- no changes to ContentScript (NFR-005).

## **11.3 No Direct Engine-to-Cache Communication**

None of the four engine components (ScoreEngine, FoodClassifier, DiseaseEngine, AlternativesEngine) read from or write to IndexedDBCache directly. All cache operations are routed through BackgroundServiceWorker. This enforces single-responsibility (engines are pure computation; BackgroundServiceWorker is the orchestrator) and makes the cache schema upgradeable without touching engine logic.

## **11.4 Single External Network Dependency**

OpenFoodFactsAPI is the only external network call in the entire system. KenyanFallbackDatabase is bundled JSON (no network). IndexedDBCache is local storage (no network). ShoppingHistory, UserProfile, and NutritionalScore are never transmitted to any server. This architectural choice was made to satisfy DATA-004 (no PII transmitted), SEC-001 (HTTPS only; single domain in CSP), and the Kenya Data Protection Act 2019 requirement that health data remain on the Consumer device.

## **11.5 Adapter Pattern for Retailer Extensibility (NFR-005)**

The IRetailerAdapter interface defines a contract for retailer-specific DOM scraping: {detectProducts(): GroceryProduct[], getRetailerCode(): RetailerCode}. Each retailer (Naivas, Carrefour Kenya) has its own adapter file implementing this interface. ContentScript imports the correct adapter based on the current tab URL. Adding a fourth or fifth retailer in future phases requires only a new adapter file -- zero changes to BackgroundServiceWorker, any engine, or UIWidget.
